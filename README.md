# SecurityAmazing-Mindmapx
A super enriched mindmaps for security professionals.
The mindmaps collection seen here is my own creation, I have painstalkingly collected valuable data, insights and view 
on different security topics, e.g secuirty engineer,security architecture, network analysis, cloud security over the period of 10 years. The sources of knowledge
or facts comes mainly from dozens of security books I have read in pursuit of certifications like ISC(2), CEH, Cloud-Security.

I have tried to be as asethethic as possible given the limitation of using free version of mind-maps. 

I hope this mindmaps would benefit secrity professionals for their daily tasks, as well can be a great source of knoweldge for interview prepation and study for security certifications.

Note:
Some mindmaps will be displaying picture as well, this is because the files were generated at time when Mindmap software Xmind used to be free:P.

# SecurityAmazing-Mindmapx
A super enriched mindmaps for security professionals.
The mindmaps collection seen here is my own creation, I have painstalkingly collected valuable data, insights and view 
on different security topics, e.g secuirty engineer,security architecture, network analysis, cloud security over the period of 10 years. The sources of knowledge
or facts comes mainly from dozens of security books I have read in pursuit of certifications like ISC(2), CEH, Cloud-Security.

I have tried to be as asethethic as possible given the limitation of using free version of mind-maps. 

I hope this mindmaps would benefit secrity professionals for their daily tasks, as well can be a great source of knoweldge for interview prepation and study for security certifications.

Note:
Some mindmaps will be displaying picture as well, this is because the files were generated at time when Mindmap software Xmind used to be free:P.

### :hammer_and_wrench: Security Engineering
The source of this mindmap comes when I was preparing for ISC(2), ISSEP exam which be very well be my toughest non-technical exam till date. Prepared it over a year and finally passed:). The map is an extract of over 8000+ pages of security text that I read and prepared for the exam, and some of the text has been taken from books or references like DoD, US-mil field manual (de-classified) 3 or 4 decades old. If you are interested in the reference material, here is the link.
